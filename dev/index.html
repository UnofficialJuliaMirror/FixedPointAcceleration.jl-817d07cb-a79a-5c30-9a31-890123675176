In some part this is likely because there is often an obvious method to find a fixed point by merely feeding a guessed fixed point into a function, taking the result and feeding it back into the function. By doing this repeatedly a fixed point is often found. This method (that we will call the &quot;Simple&quot; method) is often convergent but it is also often slow which can be prohibitive when the function itself is expensive.</p><p><strong>FixedPointAcceleration.jl</strong> aims to provide fixed point acceleration algorithms that can be much faster than the simple method. In total eight algorithms are implemented. The first is the simple method as described earlier. There are also the Newton, Aitken and Scalar Epsilon Algorithm (SEA) methods that are designed for accelerating the convergence of scalar sequences. Four algorithms for accelerating vector sequences are also implemented including the Vector Epsilon Algorithm (VEA), two minimal polynomial algorithms (MPE and RRE)  and Anderson acceleration.</p><p>In this paper section 1 starts by with a brief explanation of fixed points before section 2 describes the acceleration algorithms provided by <strong>FixedPointAcceleration.jl</strong>. Here the goal is  to illustrate the logic underling each algorithm so users can better choose which suits their problem. Readers interested in the underlying mathematics are referred to the original papers. Section 3 then illustrates a few features of the package that enable users to better track the progress of an algorithm while it is running and switch algorithms if desired before a fixed point is found.</p><p>Section 4 then presents several applications of these fixed point algorithms in economics, asset pricing and machine learning. Finally section 5 presents a convergence comparison showing how many iterations each algorithm takes in bringing each problem to its fixed point for each of the applications presented in section 4.</p><h1><a class="nav-anchor" id="Fixed-point-acceleration-1" href="#Fixed-point-acceleration-1">1 Fixed point acceleration</a></h1><p>A fixed point problem is one where we look for a vector, <span>$\hat{X} \in \Re^N$</span>, so that for a given function <span>$f: \Re^N \rightarrow \Re^N$</span> we have:</p><div>\[f(\hat{X}) = \hat{X}\]</div><p>If <span>$f: \Re^1 \rightarrow \Re^1$</span> and thus any solution <span>$\hat{X}$</span> will be a scalar then one way to solve this problem would be to use a rootfinder on the function <span>$g(x) = f(x) - x$</span> or to use an optimiser to minimise <span>$h(x) = (f(x) - x)^2$</span>. These techniques will not generally work however if <span>$f : N^a \rightarrow N^a$</span> where <span>$a$</span> is large. Consider for instance using a multidimensional Newtonian optimiser to minimise <span>$h(x) = (f(x) - x)^2$</span>. The estimation of gradients for each individual dimension may take an infeasibly long time. In addition this method may not make use all available information. Consider for instance that we know that the solution for <span>$x$</span> will be an increasing vector (so <span>$x_i &gt; x_j$</span> for any entries of <span>$x$</span>  with <span>$i &gt; j$</span>) but has many entries. This information can be preserved and used in the vector acceleration algorithms that we present but would be more difficult to exploit in a standard optimisation algorithm.</p><p><strong>FixedPointAcceleration.jl</strong> implements eight algorithms for finding fixed points. The first algorithm implemented in this package is the &quot;simple&quot; method which merely takes the output of a function and feeds it back into the function. For instance starting with a guess of <span>$x_0$</span>, the next guess will be <span>$x_1 = f(x_0)$</span>. The guess after that will be <span>$x_2 = f(x_1)$</span> and so on. In some conditions <span>$f$</span> will be a contraction mapping and so the simple method will be guaranteed to converge to a unique fixed point [@StokeyLucasPrescott1989]. Even when this is the case however the simple method may only converge slowly which can be inconvenient. The other seven methods this package implements are designed to be faster than the simple method but may not be convergent for every problem.</p><h1><a class="nav-anchor" id="Acceleration-algorithms-1" href="#Acceleration-algorithms-1">2 Acceleration algorithms</a></h1><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".1-Newton-acceleration-1" href="#.1-Newton-acceleration-1">2.1 Newton acceleration</a></h2><p>Here we will define <span>$g(x) = f(x) - x$</span>. The general approach is to solve <span>$g(x)$</span> with a rootfinder. The <span>$x$</span> that provides this root will be a fixed point.

This method is designed for use with scalar functions. If it is used with higher dimensional functions that take and return vectors then it will be used elementwise.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".3-Epsilon-algorithms-1" href="#.3-Epsilon-algorithms-1">2.3 Epsilon algorithms</a></h2><p>The epsilon algorithms introduced by @Wynn1962 provides an alternate method to extrapolate to a fixed point. This paper will present a brief numerical example and refer readers to @Wynn1962 or @SmithFordSidi1987 for a mathematical explanation of why it works. The basic epsilon algorithm starts with a column of iterates (column B in the below figure). If <span>$i$</span> iterates have been performed then this column will have a length of <span>$i+1$</span> (the initial starting guess and the results of the <span>$i$</span> iterations). Then a series of columns are generated by means of the below equation:</p><div>\[\epsilon_{c+1}^r = \epsilon_{c-1}^{r+1} + (\epsilon_{c}^{r+1} - \epsilon_{c}^{r})^{-1}\]</div><p>Where <span>$c$</span> is a column index and <span>$r$</span> is a row index. The algorithm starts with the <span>$\epsilon_0$</span> column being all zeros and <span>$\epsilon_1$</span> being the column of the sequence iterates. The value in the furthest right column ends up being the extrapolated value.</p><p>This can be seen in the below table which uses an epsilon method to find the fixed point of <span>$\cos(x)$</span> with an initial guess of a fixed point of <span>$1$</span>.</p><p><img src="EpsilonTriangle.png" alt="The Epsilon Algorithm applied to the cos(x) function"/></p><p>In this figure B1 is the initial guess of the fixed point. Then we have the iterates <span>$B2 = \cos(B1)$</span>, <span>$B3 = \cos(B2)$</span> and so on. Moving to the next column we have <span>$C1 = A2 + 1/(B2-B1)$</span> and <span>$C2 = A3 + 1/(B3-B2)$</span> and so on before finally we get <span>$F1 = D2 + 1/(E2-E1)$</span>. As this is the last entry in the triangle it is also the extrapolated value.</p><p>Note that the values in columns C and E are poor extrapolations. Only the even columns D,F provide reasonable extrapolation values. For this reason an even number of iterates (an odd number of values including the starting guess) should be used for extrapolation. <strong>FixedPointAcceleration.jl</strong>&#39;s functions will enforce this by throwing away the first iterate provided if necessary to get an even number of iterates.</p><p>In the vector case this algorithm can be visualised by considering each entry in the above table to contain a vector going into the page. In this case the complication emerges from the inverse - there is no clear interpretation of <span>$(\epsilon_{c}^{r+1} - \epsilon_{c}^{r})^{-1}$</span> where <span>$(\epsilon_{c}^{r+1} - \epsilon_{c}^{r})$</span> represents a vector. The Scalar Epsilon Algorithm (SEA) uses elementwise inverses to solve this problem which ignores the vectorised nature of the function. The Vector Epsilon Algorithm (VEA) uses the Samuelson inverse of each vector <span>$(\epsilon_{c}^{r+1} - \epsilon_{c}^{r})$</span>.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".4-Minimal-polynomial-algorithms-1" href="#.4-Minimal-polynomial-algorithms-1">2.4 Minimal polynomial algorithms</a></h2><p><strong>FixedPointAcceleration.jl</strong> implements two minimal polynomial algorithms, Minimal Polynomial Extrapolation (MPE) and Reduced Rank Extrapolation (RRE). This section will simply present the main equations but an interested reader is directed to @CabayJackson1976 or @SmithFordSidi1987 for a detailed explanation.</p><p>To first define notation, each vector (the initial guess and subsequent iterates) is defined by <span>$x_0, x_1, ...$</span> . The first differences are denoted <span>$u_j = x_{j+1} - x_{j}$</span> and the second differences are denoted <span>$v_j = u_{j+1} - u_j$</span>. If we have already completed <span>$k-1$</span> iterations (and so we have <span>$k$</span> terms) then we will use matrices of first and second differences with <span>$U = [ u_0 , u_1 , ... , u_{k-1} ]$</span> and <span>$V = [ v_0 , v_1, ... , v_{k-1} ]$</span>.</p><p>For the MPE method the extrapolated vector, <span>$s$</span>, is found by:</p><div>\[s = \frac{ \sum^k_{ j=0 }  c_j x_j }{ \sum^k_{j=0} c_j }\]</div><p>Where the coefficient vector is found by <span>$c = -U^{+} u_k$</span> where <span>$U^{+}$</span>  is the Moore-Penrose generalised inverse of the <span>$U$</span> matrix. In the case of the RRE the extrapolated vector, <span>$s$</span>, is found by:</p><div>\[s = x_0 - U V^+ u_0\]</div><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id=".5-Anderson-acceleration-1" href="#.5-Anderson-acceleration-1">2.5 Anderson acceleration</a></h2><p>@Anderson1965 acceleration is an acceleration algorithm that is well suited to functions of vectors. Similarly to the minimal polynomial algorithms it takes a weighted average of previous iterates. It is different however to these algorithms (and the VEA algorithm) in that previous iterates need not be sequential but any previous iterates can be used.</p><p>Consider that we have previously run an N-dimensional function M times. We can define a matrix <span>$G_i = [g_{i-M} , g_{i-M+1}, ... , g_i]$</span> where <span>$g(x_j) = f(x_j) - x_j$</span>. Each column of this matrix can be interpreted as giving the amount of ``movement&#39;&#39; that occurred in a run of the function.</p><p>Now Anderson acceleration defines a weight to apply to each column of the matrix. This weight vector is M-dimensional and can be denoted <span>$\{\mathbf{\alpha} = \alpha_0, \alpha_1,  ... , \alpha_M\}$</span>. These weights are determined by means of the following optimisation:</p><div>\[\min_\mathbf{\alpha} \vert\vert G_i \mathbf{\alpha} \vert\vert_2\]</div><div>\[\hspace{1cm} s.t. \sum^M_{j=0} \alpha_j = 1\]</div><p>Thus we choose the weights that will be predicted to create the lowest ``movement&#39;&#39; in an iteration.</p><p>With these weights we can then create the expression for the next iterate as:</p><div>\[x_{i+1} = \sum_{j=0}^M \alpha_j f(x_{i-M+j})\]</div><p>The actual implementation differs from the proceeding description by recasting the optimisation problem as an unconstrained least squares problem (see @FangSaad2009 or @WalkerNi2011) but in practical terms is identical.</p><footer><hr/></footer></article></body></html>
